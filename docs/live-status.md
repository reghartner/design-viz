# Live ticket status

Live ticket references connect a diagram's implementation work to Jira without
copying changing status into the authored spec. Hardware, firmware, UX and backend
work can be tracked on the nodes and the interactions between them.

## Fields

Any diagram node or edge can carry these optional references:

```json
{
  "tickets": ["HW-123", "FW-45"],
  "prs": ["https://github.com/acme/firmware/pull/88"]
}
```

`tickets` accepts strings matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+-[0-9]+$`; keys are case
sensitive and are not trimmed. `prs` accepts absolute HTTP(S) URL strings using
the same URL normalization as delta links. Invalid entries warn individually
and are ignored. Non-array fields warn once and are ignored, including explicit
null. The shared `trackingRefs(obj)` parser returns valid, deduplicated references
in authored order without modifying the source.

Place the optional Jira site on the page, beside `title`, `contract` and `flowview`:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "title": "Connected doorbell delivery",
    "tracking": {"jira": {"site": "https://acme.atlassian.net"}}
  }
}
```

This is a metadata excerpt; a complete page also needs sections or blocks.
`tracking` must be an object and a present `tracking.jira.site` must be an
absolute HTTP(S) URL string. Invalid values warn and are ignored; tracking
validation never turns them into errors.

## Workbench

Select a node or connection on the desktop canvas and open **Inspect → Tracking**,
just below the change details. In **Add ticket**, enter a Jira key such as `HW-123`
and press Enter. Keys are case sensitive; surrounding whitespace is trimmed.
In **Add PR**, paste an absolute HTTP(S) URL and press Enter. Duplicate references
are ignored. Each list keeps its order; use its numbered **Remove ticket** or
**Remove PR** button to remove an entry. Each add or removal has one Undo/Redo,
and Export project keeps the references in its JSON.

When the document has tickets, **Demo live status** beside **Preview** supplies
sample states in sorted ticket order. It starts off and stays preview-only across
ordinary edits and skin changes; it never saves status to the spec or contacts Jira.
Live colors require a viewer with the live-status overlay and a status provider.
PRs remain plain links.

## State model

The planned overlay uses these runtime states. The spec never stores status.

| State | Paint |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | Grey |
| `active` | Amber, slow pulse |
| `done` | Green |
| `blocked` | Red pulse |
| `missing` | Red pulse + hatched badge |

For an element with several tickets, roll up their states in this order:

blocked > missing > active > (all done → done) > (all todo → todo) > otherwise active

Steps, coins and chips derive their state from the edges and nodes they involve
and never carry tickets. Live status color comes from Jira status only.
Authored `prs` are plain links and never carry live state. A Jira-linked PR
summary from Jira's Development field is informational; it does not determine
status or color.

## Compatibility

The capability is `flow.live-status`, introduced in Flowview 0.2.0. Non-empty
`tickets` or `prs` arrays on nodes or edges, or a page `tracking` field, cause
compatibility stamping to declare it automatically. Existing specs without these
fields keep their existing requirements.

## Rendering

This child adds the fields, shared parser, validation and compatibility declaration.
The overlay itself lands in the next child (#735); these references do not yet
change rendering or fetch Jira data.

The [live-status example](../examples/live-status/live-status.spec.json) connects
hardware, firmware, a mobile app and backend with node and edge references.

## Mock server

The [mock Atlassian MCP server](../deploy/cloudflare/mock-atlassian-mcp/README.md)
provides fictional Jira tools without an Atlassian account. Its shared timeline
demonstrates progress, blocked and missing tickets, and linked PR summaries.
